# HARDWARE

## Development
For infos look at [Development](./DEV.md)

## State
The first iteration of hardware will will feature a single package consisting of a PCB, screen, battery & enclosure.

PCB:
- GNSS sensor
- USB-C port only supporting USB 2.0 (5v & slow data transfer)
- micro SD slot for storage
- LCD-TFT screen
- STM32H7 
- Charging circute

Exterior:
Simple 

## Not planned for the first iteration of hardware 
Proper seals & weather-proofing (The first iteration is more a proof of concept rather than a finished product).
Exchangeable batteries (this just adds complexity that is "easy to add" at a later stage of the project).


## Planned
- Weather-proof enclosure
- battery:
  - changeable battery packs
  - different sizes of battery packs
  - packs rechargeable independent of main unit
- USB-C with support for USB 3 speeds
